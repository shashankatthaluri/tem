# TEM — Project Overview

> **"Speak your expenses. We track it."**

---

## What is Tem?

**Tem** is a **voice-first, minimalist mobile expense tracker** that fundamentally reimagines how people manage their personal finances. Unlike traditional expense trackers that demand manual data entry, complex categorizations, and overwhelming dashboards, Tem allows users to simply *speak* their expenses naturally.

The app converts voice into structured expense data, intelligently categorizes it, confirms correctness, and learns from user corrections — all within a calm, black-and-white interface.

## The Philosophy

### Why Tem Exists

Most expense trackers fail because they:
- Require tedious manual data entry
- Force users to think in rigid categories
- Overwhelm with charts, alerts, and guilt-inducing analytics
- Feel like financial dashboards rather than personal tools

**What users actually want:**
- Zero-effort logging
- Natural input (voice)
- Confidence that data is correct
- A calm experience they can return to daily

### The Core Belief

> *"I don't want to manage money — I want awareness."*

Tem is designed to remove friction, not add control. It avoids dashboards, alerts, and guilt-inducing analytics. The app prioritizes **trust, calm, and accuracy**.

## Product Mantra

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Minimal Input** | Speak naturally. No forms. No thinking. |
| **Maximum Trust** | Always confirm. Always allow correction. |
| **Zero Noise** | Black & white. No visual clutter. No pressure. |

---

## Core Principles

1. **Voice First** — Speaking is the default interaction
2. **Minimalism** — Black & white, no visual noise
3. **Trust Over Automation** — Always confirm, always allow correction
4. **Calm by Default** — No pressure, no guilt
5. **One Clear Loop** — Log → Confirm → Learn
