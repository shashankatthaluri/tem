# TEM — Version 1.1 Roadmap

> Post-launch feature roadmap and enhancements.

---

## Vision for v1.1

After v1.0 launch and initial user feedback, v1.1 focuses on:
1. **Accuracy improvements** — Better AI parsing
2. **User requests** — Top-voted features
3. **Retention boosters** — Features that bring users back
4. **Technical debt** — Clean up MVP shortcuts

---

## Priority 1: Core Improvements

### Enhanced AI Parsing

| Feature | Description | Effort |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Multi-expense support | "Coffee $5 and lunch $12" | Medium |
| Date/time extraction | "Dinner yesterday at $50" | Medium |
| Merchant recognition | "Starbucks" → auto-categorize | High |
| Currency detection | "50 euros" → EUR | Low |
| Correction learning | Use past corrections in prompts | Medium |

### Improved Accuracy Feedback Loop

```
User speaks → AI parses → User corrects → System learns
                                              ↓
                              Next time, same input = correct category
```

## Priority 2: User Experience

### Onboarding Flow

| Screen | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Welcome | Introduce the app concept |
| Permission | Request microphone access |
| Demo | Show how voice input works |
| First expense | Guide first interaction |

### Empty States

| Screen | Empty State Message |
|--------|---------------------|
| Main | "Start by speaking an expense" |
| Summary | "No expenses this month yet" |
| History | "No expenses in this category" |

### Haptic Feedback Refinement
- Stronger feedback on recording start
- Subtle feedback on popup appear
- Confirmation vibration on save

---

## Priority 3: New Features

### Recurring Expenses

> Users have recurring bills they don't want to say every month.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Add recurring | Mark expense as recurring |
| Auto-add | Option to auto-log monthly |
| Reminder | Notify to confirm recurring |

**Implementation approach**: Keep it simple — just a flag, manual confirmation.

### Multiple Currencies

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| User default | Set home currency in profile |
| Per-expense | "50 euros" parsed correctly |
| Conversion | Optional display in home currency |

**No real-time rates** — Keep offline-first, use static rates.

### Data Import

| Source | Priority |
|--------|----------|
| CSV import | High |
| Excel import | Medium |
| Bank statement | Low (complex) |

---

## Priority 4: Platform Features

### Widgets

| Platform | Widget Type |
|----------|-------------|
| iOS | Monthly total widget |
| Android | Quick-add widget |

### Apple Watch

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Voice input | Speak from wrist |
| Glance | Monthly total |

### Siri/Assistant Integration

| Command | Action |

| "How much did I spend this month" | Read total |

---

## Priority 5: Technical Improvements

### Offline Support

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Queue system | Store expenses locally |
| Sync on connect | Upload when online |
| Conflict resolution | Handle duplicates |

### On-Device STT

| Apple Speech | iOS native |
| Google Speech | Android native |

### Analytics

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Amplitude | User behavior |
| Sentry | Crash reporting |
| Custom events | Conversion tracking |

---

## Deferred to v1.2+

### Budgeting (Maybe v1.2)
- Monthly budget setting
- Category limits
- Alerts when approaching limits

**Why deferred**: Goes against "calm" philosophy. Needs careful design.

### Social Features (v2.0)
- Family sharing
- Split expenses
- Shared budgets

**Why deferred**: Significant complexity. Focus on single-user first.

### Bank Sync (v2.0)
- Plaid integration
- Auto-import transactions
- Duplicate detection

**Why deferred**: Regulatory, security, and technical complexity.

## User Research Needed

Before building v1.1 features, validate:

1. **What frustrates users most?**
   - Parsing accuracy?
   - Missing features?
   - UX friction?

2. **What brings users back?**
   - Summary view?
   - Export feature?
   - Just logging habit?

3. **Why do users churn?**
   - Forgot to use?
   - Found alternative?
   - Didn't see value?

---

## Feature Request Tracking

Will collect feedback via:
- In-app feedback button
- App store reviews
- Direct email
- Social mentions

Prioritize by:
1. Frequency of request
2. Alignment with vision
3. Implementation effort
4. Revenue impact

---

## Philosophy Guardrails

When evaluating v1.1 features, check against:

| Question | Expected Answer |
|----------|-----------------|
| Does it reduce friction? | Yes |
| Does it add complexity? | No |
| Does it create pressure? | No |
| Does it maintain calm? | Yes |
| Does it respect privacy? | Yes |

If any feature fails these checks, reconsider or redesign.
